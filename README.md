# WOPR_and_friends
This is where I store my various CTF themed programs.

WOPR - This program is designed to ONLY enumerate targets on various CTF platforms. Ideally, this program will be able to point exactly where to look to allow users to speed up time looking for vulnerabilities and get right to the exploiting. The file's readme will include what it is programmed for.

Skynet - This program is designed to enumerate AND exploit targets on various CTF platforms. In theory, this program will either auto exploit the target or give instructions to get to the next step if it is not possible for the program to actually exploit the system.

PirateBoi - This program is designed to help Skynet and WOPR with pillaging systems and look for information from the system to assist with either pivoting to different systems or just grabbing credentials. It will also clean up a system from exploits afterwards if prompted to.
